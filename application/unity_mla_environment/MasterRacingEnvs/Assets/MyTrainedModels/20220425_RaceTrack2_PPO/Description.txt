Scene settings:
1) Directional light turned off.
2) Vehicle Controller:
    - Turned off all car driving assists except of ABS.
    - Gearbox set to automatic with 0 seconds time for Gear transition time and shift interval.

Input:
1) Visual observations: 240x135 RGB images
2) Vector observations:
    - normalized speed (float value from range [-1:1]). Negative speed is for reverse driving.
    - collision flag -> 1.0f if car currently collides with barrier, 0.0f otherwise.

Output:
1) Steering angle as normalized value from range [-1:1].
2) Throttle/braking level as normalized value from range [-1:1].

Training details:
1) Model trained on RaceTrack_2 scene, with single instance of car agent.
2) Each episode always started from the same car position and rotation:
    - Car Position: Vector3(13.6800003,-1.28699994,-10.2700005)
    - Car Rotation: Vector3(0,90,0)
3) PPO used to train a model (check configuration).
4) Training took 1647798 simulation steps.
5) Max Step set to 3600.
6) Decision requester:
    - Decision Period: 2
    - Take Actions between Decisions: true

Model as a training result:
1) Model is able to drive safely several laps before crashing. Driving pace is quite unstable. Time trial executed for 8 laps resulted in following lap times:
    1. 55,06 s
    2. 55,86 s
    3. 57,84 s
    4. 60,80 s <- WORST
    5. 56,20 s
    6. 57,46 s
    7. 48,74 s <- BEST
    8. DNF (crash on the first corner).

Difference between best and worst lap time is 12 seconds.

2) Model cannot continue driving after serious crash, when car is rotated circa 90 degrees to the road.
3) Model cannot deal with directional light turned on, when road color becomes brighter and brighter.

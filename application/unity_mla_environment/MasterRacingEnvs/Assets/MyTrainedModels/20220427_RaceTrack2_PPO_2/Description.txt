Scene settings:
1) Directional ligth turned on, and set to different positions, orientations, intensities and colors for each episode.
2) Vehicle Controller:
    - Turned off all car driving assists except of ABS.
    - Gearbox set to automatic with 0 seconds time for Gear transition time and shift interval.

Input:
1) Visual observations: 240x135 RGB images
2) Vector observations:
    - normalized speed (float value from range [-1:1]). Negative speed is for reverse driving.
    - collision flag -> 1.0f if car currently collides with barrier, 0.0f otherwise.

Output:
1) Steering angle as normalized value from range [-1:1].
2) Throttle/braking level as normalized value from range [-1:1].

Training details:
1) Model trained on RaceTrack_2 scene, with single instance of car agent.
2) Each episode always started from the same car position and rotation:
    - Car Position: Vector3(13.6800003,-1.28699994,-10.2700005)
    - Car Rotation: Vector3(0,90,0)
3) PPO used to train a model (check configuration).
4) Training took 4654498 simulation steps.
5) Max Step set to 3600.
6) Decision requester:
    - Decision Period: 2
    - Take Actions between Decisions: true

Model as a training result:
1) Model is able to drive safely several laps before crashing. Driving pace is much more stable than for previous model. Difference between best and worst lap times is often not greater than 3 seconds, but it depends on the light being set for given episode.

2) Model cannot continue driving after serious crash, when car is rotated circa 90 degrees to the road.
3) Model is able to deal with various directional light settings, but still are some edge cases, where agent behaviour is suboptimal.
